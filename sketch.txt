Input --> Images, Annotations. 
Output --> 2 numpy arrays. X => our features (image pixels); Y => bounding-boxed + classes. 

1 program (executable) => turns images and annotations into a memory efficient data source.
1 library => exposes a class. This class is a data generator which allows you to load your data into memory in little chunks.

1) This program

Interfaces:
    IImageReader => exposes public Read method. Takes an image and turns it into a numpy array.
    IAnnotationReader => exposes public Read method. Takes an annotation and deserializes it into an Annotation class.
    IAnnotationTansformer => exposes a public Transform method. Takes an instance of the Annotation class and turns it into a numpy array. 
    IWriter => exposes a public Write method. Takes a numpy array and writes it to the hard drive.
